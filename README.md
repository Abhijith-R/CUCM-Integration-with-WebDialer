# CUCM-Integration-with-WebDialer-using-SOAP
This project was developed for a Smart city project in India. The Incident management portal can be used by incident managers to call a specific incident team on a click of a button instead of dialing out a number which would consume time and effort. This project intends to make the incident response quicker and agile.

The Dashboard has three different buttons which dials out to different number with respect to the incident. It also has a counter to keep a track on how many successful call were made.
